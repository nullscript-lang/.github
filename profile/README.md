## üì¶ Featured Projects

Here's a glimpse of the exciting projects we're currently building and maintaining:

### `nullscript`

Our flagship project, `nullscript`, is an ambitious new programming language designed for [briefly describe core focus, e.g., "high-performance systems", "scalable web applications", "elegant scripting"]. Built entirely in Rust, it aims to provide [mention a key benefit, e.g., "memory safety without garbage collection", "expressive syntax", "powerful concurrency features"]. We are committed to developing a language that is both a joy to write and incredibly efficient in execution.

**Tech Stack**: `Rust`

**Repository**: [nullscript-lang/nullscript](https://github.com/nullscript-lang/nullscript)

**Live Demo**: *[Coming Soon!] - As an organization building a language, a direct "live demo" might be a compiler playground or REPL.*
